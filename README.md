# my-experiments
The repository contains my various experiments, submissions, practice codes which I had done so far.

### machine learning/ NN for census income 

This was started as a part of submission towards an instituted assignment. Building on that some new implementations were added. 
It includes implementation of Neural Network (2 layers: 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer) from scratch using numpy, pandas et cetera python libraries.

### python This folder includes two games.

- Lucky draw with dice
- Tic Tac Toe Try your hands at them. I hope you will enjoy.

### Acknowledgement 

I have writtem all the code present in this repo after concerning various online and offline resources. The online resources include blogs, videos, documentations et cetera and offline resources include my friends, mentors and teachers. I am grateful to all of them.

### Upcoming tasks to complete-

- Implement NN weight initialization using Genetic Algorithm.
- Learn fast computing libraries and implement above techniques using them.
- Include minimum spanning tree using BGL.
- Include and learn implementation of audio/video support
